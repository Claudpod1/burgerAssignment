Burger Application 

<b> The Objective </b>

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

<b> Functionality </b>

The app displays two columns, a column for edible hamburgers and devoured hamburgers. There is a submit feature on the page as well, if the user would like to add a hamburger to the edible column, to be devoured.
